# Documentation Workspace — Slide Deck

## Overview
This workspace contains documentation artifacts for a slide presentation titled **"Slide Deck"**. At the time of writing, the outline and section requirements are known, but the topic, audience, goal, length, and style preferences have not been provided. The documents in this folder therefore focus on preserving the required structure and clearly recording the open inputs needed to finalize slide content.

## What is included
This folder includes:
1. A presentation content outline and slide-by-slide draft structure.
2. A set of assumptions and placeholders that indicate what must be filled in once the topic and audience are known.
3. Notes on how an available image asset could be used (if desired) as a visual or thematic element.

## Open inputs required to finalize the deck
To convert the draft into a completed slide deck, the following inputs are still required:
- The presentation topic and domain context.
- The target audience (e.g., executives, engineers, customers, students).
- The goal (e.g., persuade, inform, align, request funding, teach).
- The intended length (number of minutes and/or number of slides).
- Any style constraints (tone, brand, visual theme, formality level).

## Related references
An image design note exists outside this workspace at `assets/image_01_design_notes.md`. It describes a photograph that could be used as a banner/hero visual with an orange-and-charcoal palette. The deck draft references this only as an optional visual direction.
