# Slide Deck — Inputs Needed to Finalize Content

## Purpose
This document lists the minimal inputs required to transform the current slide deck outline into finished slide content.

## Required inputs
### Topic
Provide a one-paragraph description of the deck topic and its boundaries (what is in scope and what is out of scope).

### Audience
Describe who will view the deck and what they already know.
Include their likely decision rights (e.g., approve budget, provide feedback, adopt process).

### Goal
State what you want the audience to do after the presentation.
Examples include approving a decision, aligning on strategy, adopting a plan, or understanding a problem.

### Length and format
- Desired duration in minutes.
- Maximum number of slides (if constrained).
- Delivery context (live talk, async sharing, board meeting, workshop).

### Style preferences
- Tone: formal, conversational, persuasive, instructional.
- Visual style: minimal, data-heavy, story-driven, brand-aligned.
- Any do-not-do constraints (e.g., no dense tables, no external links, no stock photos).

## Optional helpful inputs
### Evidence availability
List what evidence exists now (metrics, reports, anecdotes, screenshots) and where it lives.

### Recommendations constraints
Any constraints on recommendations:
- Budget ceiling
- Timeline requirements
- Technology stack limitations
- Staffing constraints
- Compliance/security constraints

### Assets
If you want to use the available photo reference, confirm:
- Whether it is appropriate for the topic and audience
- Any required attribution or usage restrictions
- Preferred placement (title slide, section divider, background only)
