# Slide Deck — Draft Outline and Content Plan

## Status
This document is a draft content plan for a slide presentation titled **"Slide Deck"**. The required outline is known, but the topic, audience, and presentation goal are not yet specified. For that reason, several sections use placeholders that must be replaced when those inputs are provided.

## Presentation metadata (to be provided)
### Topic
The deck topic is not specified yet. The slide titles and prompts below are written to be adaptable to most topics.

### Audience
The intended audience is not specified yet. The level of technical detail and the amount of supporting data should be adjusted once the audience is known.

### Goal
The goal is not specified yet. The recommendations and next steps section should be aligned to the goal, such as approval, alignment, funding, adoption, or education.

### Length
The length is not specified yet. The outline supports a short deck (8–12 slides) but can be expanded by adding evidence slides and deep-dive key point slides.

## Slide-by-slide plan

## 1. Title slide
### Purpose
Introduce the topic and set a professional context.

### Suggested content
The title slide should include:
- Title: **Slide Deck**
- Subtitle (placeholder): "[Insert topic subtitle]"
- Presenter (placeholder): "[Name], [Role/Team]"
- Date (placeholder): "[Date]"

### Optional visual direction
If using the available photo reference (see `assets/image_01_design_notes.md`), it can serve as a banner image with a readability overlay. The orange accent color can be used consistently for headings or callouts.

## 2. Agenda
### Purpose
Set expectations and give the audience a mental map.

### Suggested content
The agenda should mirror the outline:
- Problem / Context
- Key points (3–5)
- Evidence / Examples
- Recommendations / Next steps
- Summary
- Q&A

### Speaker note guidance
If time is limited, state explicitly which sections will be covered lightly and which will be the focus.

## 3. Problem / Context
### Purpose
Explain why this topic matters now and what the current situation is.

### Suggested content (placeholders)
- Current state: "[What is happening today?]"
- Impact: "[What does it cost or risk?]"
- Stakeholders: "[Who is affected?]"
- Constraints: "[Budget, time, dependencies, compliance, capabilities]"

### Definition of “problem statement”
This slide should define the problem in one sentence that is measurable or observable, not just a general complaint.

## 4. Key points (3–5 slides)
### Purpose
Deliver the main narrative as discrete, memorable claims.

### Structure recommendation
Use one key point per slide. Keep each slide oriented around a single sentence claim, then support it with 2–3 pieces of evidence, examples, or implications.

### Key point slide template
Each key point slide should include:
- Claim: "[Short statement]"
- Why it matters: "[Consequence]"
- What it affects: "[Users/systems/processes]"
- Transition: "[How this leads to the next point]"

### Suggested key point placeholders
Because the topic is unknown, define key points in a generic pattern:
1. Key point 1: "[Primary driver or root cause]"
2. Key point 2: "[Constraints or risks]"
3. Key point 3: "[Opportunities or leverage points]"
4. Key point 4 (optional): "[Alternative options considered]"
5. Key point 5 (optional): "[What success looks like / target state]"

## 5. Evidence / Examples
### Purpose
Substantiate the claims with concrete support.

### Suggested evidence types
Pick the evidence type that matches the topic:
- Metrics and trends (charts, simple tables)
- Before/after comparisons
- Case studies or user anecdotes
- Audit findings or incident summaries
- Competitive or market references
- Prototype screenshots or workflow examples

### Guidance when evidence is limited
If there is little formal evidence, use this slide to:
- Define what evidence will be collected next.
- Show early signals and explain limitations.

## 6. Recommendations / Next steps
### Purpose
Convert analysis into an actionable plan.

### Recommended structure
- Recommendation: "[What to do]"
- Rationale: "[Why this is the right move]"
- Scope: "[What is included/excluded]"
- Timeline: "[Now / Next / Later]"
- Owners: "[Who leads]"
- Dependencies and risks: "[What must be true]"
- Decision requested (placeholder): "[Approval, resources, alignment]"

### Output orientation
This slide should make it easy for the audience to say “yes” by clarifying what exactly is being asked.

## 7. Summary
### Purpose
Reinforce the narrative and close with clarity.

### Suggested content
Summarize in three sentences:
1. The problem / context in one sentence.
2. The key message (what you want remembered).
3. The action requested or next step.

### Optional success definition
Include a short success criterion that is measurable: "[Metric], by [date], reaching [target]."

## 8. Q&A
### Purpose
Create space for discussion.

### Suggested content
Keep the slide clean. Optionally add:
- Contact: "[email / channel]"
- Link to supporting doc: "[placeholder]"
- Appendix pointer: "[if applicable]"

## Optional appendix (if needed)
If the deck becomes longer or more detailed, add an appendix section containing:
- Definitions and acronyms
- Data methodology
- Implementation plan details
- Risk register
- Alternate options and trade-offs

## Content and design notes (optional)
If the image reference is used, the palette described in `assets/image_01_design_notes.md` suggests:
- Orange as an accent for key callouts.
- Charcoal/dark neutrals for text.
- A subtle dark gradient overlay on images to preserve readability of titles.
This is optional and should be aligned with any brand or style requirements once provided.
